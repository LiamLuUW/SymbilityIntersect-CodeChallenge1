# SymbilityIntersect-CodeChallenge1
This is a code challenge project for symbility intersect. The functionality of this app is allowing user to view a variety of crypto currencies and set up favoured currencies which will be pinned at the top of the list.

In this challenge, I practiced some new Android libraries such as LiveData, ViewModel, and Room.
